Special Thanks:
  raysfire for his tutorials.
  JarateKing for documentation.
  Whisker for BudHud which I used as a reference point for a lot of the HUD elements I couldn't quite figure out (plus I stole the chat box directly from the HUD teehee).
  Griever for ToonHUD which I use as inspiration I guess.
  yesod for yesodHUD which I also used as inspiration. (I promise I customised the MvM hud myself.)
  And whoever decides to actually download and use this thing lmao.
